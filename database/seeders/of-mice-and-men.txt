<h1>Of Mice and Men</h1><div>John Steinbeck<br><br></div><h1>Introduction</h1><div><em>Of Mice and Men</em> is a novella written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck"><strong>John Steinbeck</strong></a>. Published in 1937, it narrates the experiences of <strong>George Milton</strong> and <strong>Lennie Small</strong>, two displaced migrant ranch workers, who move from place to place in California in search of new job opportunities during the Great Depression in the United States.<br><br></div><h1>Introduction II</h1><div>Steinbeck based the novella on his own experiences working alongside migrant farm workers as a teenager in the 1910s (before the arrival of the Okies that he would describe in The Grapes of Wrath). The title is taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns"><strong>Robert Burns</strong></a>' poem "To a Mouse", which reads: "The best laid schemes of mice and men / Often go awry”<br><br></div><h1>Introduction III</h1><div>While it is a book taught in many schools, Of Mice and Men has been a frequent target of censors for vulgarity, and what some consider offensive and racist language; consequently, it appears on the American Library Association's list of the Most Challenged Books of 21st Century.<br><br></div><h1>Characters</h1><ul><li>George Milton</li><li>Lennie Small</li><li>Candy</li><li>Slim</li><li>Curley</li><li>Curley's wife</li><li>others</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>George Milton</h1><div>A quick-witted man who is Lennie's guardian and best friend. His friendship with Lennie helps sustain his dream of a better future. He was bound in teasing Lennie since he was young. He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as "small and quick," every part of him being "defined," with small strong hands on slender arms.<br><br></div><h1>Lennie Small</h1><div>A mentally disabled, but gigantic and physically strong man who travels with George and is his constant companion. He dreams of "living off the fatta' the lan'" and being able to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things conspires against him, mostly because he does not know his own strength.<br><br></div><h1>Candy</h1><div>An aging ranch handyman, Candy lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch. Fearing that his age is making him useless, he seizes on George's description of the farm he and Lennie will have, offering his life's savings if he can join George and Lennie in owning the land.<br><br></div><h1>Slim</h1><div>A "jerkline skinner," the main driver of a mule team and the "prince of the ranch". Slim is greatly respected by many of the characters and is the only character whom Curley treats with respect. His insight, intuition, kindness and natural authority draw the other ranch hands automatically towards him.<br><br></div><h1>Curley</h1><div>The Boss' son, a young, pugnacious character, once a semi-professional boxer. He is described by others, with some irony, as "handy", partly because he likes to keep a glove filled with vaseline on his left hand. He is very jealous and protective of his wife and immediately develops a dislike toward Lennie.&nbsp;<br><br></div><h1>Curley's wife</h1><div>Curley's wife: A young, pretty woman, who is mistrusted by her husband. The other characters refer to her only as "Curley's wife". Steinbeck explained that she is "not a person, she's a symbol. She has no function, except to be a foil – and a danger to Lennie."<br><br><br><em>The End<br></em><br><br></div>
